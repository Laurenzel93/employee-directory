# React User Directoy
Deployed Link:  https://laurenzel93.github.io/user-directory/<br>
GitHub Page: https://github.com/Laurenzel93/employee-directory <br>

## User Story
* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render. 

The user should be able to:
  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
